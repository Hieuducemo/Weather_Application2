# Weather_Application2
I was inspired by the project Movie Reccomendation by senior Dang Quy Tai in 23-5KB-C. Use the API to get information from a web, here specifically https://openweathermap.org/. I created a program capable of showing the current weather of a country in general and a city in particular through factors such as temperature, humidity, sunrise and sunset times..
This project can be developed more by adding forecast, more picture with the weather and better graphics development.
